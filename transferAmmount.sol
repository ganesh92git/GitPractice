    After Migration:
    since the UI part is not done you should try the following commands through the terminal to transfer amounts between the accounts:
    I did this :


    truffle console
    transferAmmount.deployed().then(function(instance){app = instance})
    app.deposit(0, {from:web3.eth.accounts[2],value:web3.toWei(10,'ether')})
    app.withdraw(0)
